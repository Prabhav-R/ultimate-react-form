# ULTIMATE FORMIK FORM

This is repo based on the [Ultimate React Hook Form Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-iz8b4RExA) in which [react-hook-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form) is used. I have implemented the same form with the [formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik).

## [Demo](https://ultimate-formik-form.netlify.app/)

The form features include:

- multi-step / wizard form

- form field validation on blur ( using yup )

- form field masking / normalisation

- dependent form fields

- custom form inputs

- using react-hook-form with material-ui

- file uploads using the dropzone ( using the react dropzone )
